# webclient

This is the official webclient for the Uvio platform. The communication between
[webclient] and [apiserver] is managed using the auto generated [apitscode]
library.

```
npm install https://github.com/uvio-network/apitscode.git#v0.1.0
```

Run the webclient locally together with the [apiserver] and you are good to go.

```
npm run dev
```



[apiserver]: https://github.com/uvio-network/apiserver
[apitscode]: https://github.com/uvio-network/apitscode
